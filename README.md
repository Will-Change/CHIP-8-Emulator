# CHIP-8-Emulator
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers. 

this is nothing but a chip8 emulator(or technically an interpreter), to run this thing just make sure you have sdl installed and run it, 
get the roms from this place - https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms, everything should be running properly except tetris for some reason(the tetris rom that i used was not from this tho).

# Compiling and Running
on xcode:
first install sdl2 if you dont have it already (brew install sdl2), then on xcode link the binary with the libraries(nothing, in build phase just select your sdl2 framework from /usr/local/Cellar). Now that you're set up just download any rom, then run the program (i'll include some public domain roms in some directory later, maybe i dont know).
